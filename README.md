WhisperFrames is a state-of-the-art deep learning GAN-based image steganography CLI tool with a frontend built on React. This project leverages cutting-edge techniques in machine learning and steganography to encode and decode messages within images securely and efficiently.

## Overview

WhisperFrames consists of two main components:
1. **Model Training and GAN Implementation:** The core model is trained and fine-tuned at the Pakistan Institute of Engineering & Applied Sciences (PIEAS) Pattern Recognition Lab. The GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) part of the project is implemented using PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework.
2. **Frontend Interface:** The frontend is built using React, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the steganography tool. Users can easily upload images, encode text messages, and decode them using the intuitive GUI.

## Features

- **Deep Learning-based Steganography:** Utilizes GANs to embed messages within images, making detection and extraction highly secure.
- **User-friendly Interface:** React-based frontend allows for easy navigation and usage of the tool.
- **Secure Encoding and Decoding:** Ensures that messages are safely embedded and can be accurately retrieved without loss or corruption.
- **Efficient Processing:** Optimized for performance, allowing for quick encoding and decoding of messages.

## Technologies Used

- **PyTorch:** For model training and GAN implementation.
- **React:** For building the frontend interface.
- **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks):** Core technology for image steganography.

## Usage

- **Encode Message:**
  - Upload a cover image using the provided interface.
  - Enter the text message you want to encode.
  - Click on the "Encode" button to embed the message within the image.

- **Decode Message:**
  - Upload the steganographic image containing the encoded message.
  - Click on the "Decode" button to retrieve the hidden message.
